Workflow or user / system flow Here is a workflow describing how features interact from the perspective of different actors: customer, cleaning team, admin. Workflow of features (step by step) 1. Customer journey (front end) 1. Customer visits site / app → sees home page with available services, locations, pricing (or request quote). 2. Customer registers / logs in → creates an account. 3. Customer selects service type, add-ons (rooms, frequency, special cleaning). 4. The customer sees available service areas or enters address / postal code to check service availability. 5. Customer adds services to cart or builder → computes cost (instant quote). 6. The customer chooses to pay via wallet deposit or pay the full amount. ○ If no wallet funds: customer can load funds into wallet (top-up) via payment gateway (credit card, etc.). ○ Or pay directly using payment gateway or pay deposit only (e.g. 30% deposit). 7. Customer schedules appointments (select date/time slot). 8. After booking, a cleaning team is assigned. The customer sees the upcoming appointment in the dashboard. 9. On the day of cleaning, the cleaning process begins in stages (see below). Customers can watch progress (tracking). 10. At each stage, the cleaning team uploads pictures (before, during, after) and marks the stage as complete. Customer gets notification + sees images. 11. After the final stage is completed, cleaning is done → job is closed. 12. Customers can leave review + rating + feedback. 13. Customers can use referral / share links so others can use your services; after successful referral (new customer signs up), rewards are applied (discount or wallet credit). 14. Customers can view past jobs, wallet balance, upcoming appointments, review history. 2. Cleaning team / staff workflow 1. Cleaner logs into their staff portal. 2. The cleaner sees their assigned job details (address, cleaning type, date/time, service instructions). 3. Cleaner arrives and starts job → performs stage 1 (e.g. prepping). 4. Upload pictures (pre condition). Marks stage 1 complete.
5. Moves to stage 2 (cleaning rooms). Uploads pictures, marks complete. 6. Stage 3 (quality check or finishing). Uploads pictures, marks complete. 7. Final stage maybe customer check or closing job. 8. If there are issues or missing tasks, the cleaner can flag exceptions. 9. Job completes → triggers admin / customer notification that job is done. 3. Admin / business owner workflow 1. Admin logs into the admin portal. 2. Admin defines service types (packages, rooms, add-ons), pricing, service areas (postal codes, neighbourhoods). 3. Admin views scheduled appointments, assigns staff to jobs. 4. Admin monitors cleaning jobs in progress. Can view images / stages from the cleaning team. 5. Admin approves or reviews flagged exceptions or issues. 6.
